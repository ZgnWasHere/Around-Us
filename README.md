If you get {module_name} not defined error, heres the libs:
Random
Time
Keyboard
Colorama
To download them, do `pip install {module_name}`

If you get any error send me the error on `zgnbusiness@outlook.com` or on discord `Zgn#5681`

You can suggest updates on my dc `Zgn#5681`

If you wanna send something on mail probably i'll see it so late, sending on dc is more effective

I made this game in 3 days, thats all im saying, enjoy.
